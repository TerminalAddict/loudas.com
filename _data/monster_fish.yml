  habitat: "Tends to inhabit slow-moving to still tributaries, backwaters and lagoons during the dry season, and moves into areas of flooded forest during periods of inundation. It is chiefly a surface dweller preying on smaller fishes and terrestrial insects, and is famed for its ability to leap high out of the water to catch the latter."

- name: "Red-bellied Pacu"
  scientific_name: "Piaractus brachypomus"
  image: pacu.jpg
  habitat: "Inhabits main river channels and flood plains, moving into flooded forests during the rainy season. It tends to prefer shallow, slow-moving areas with overhanging or floating vegetation. Juveniles spend the first few months of life in the flood plains, where food is plentiful and predation is less of a danger."
  size: "600 mm."

- name: "Red Stripped Earth Eater"
  scientific_name: "Geophagus suramenises / Geophagus altifrons"
  image: geophagus.jpg
  habitat: "Predominantly found in the lower reaches of rivers, appearing to be restricted by the first stretch of rapids encountered, and has also been collected from floodplain lakes in Várzea (literally ‘flooded forest’) regions. It is said to show a preference for clear and black water environments as opposed to turbid ‘white’ waters and tends to inhabit gently sloping marginal zones around shores or islands with substrates of sand, fine gravel and mud."
  size: "225 mm."
