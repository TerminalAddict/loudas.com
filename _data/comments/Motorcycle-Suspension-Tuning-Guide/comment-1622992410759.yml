message: "Wow, very impressive.  This article is the most comprehensive, without being too detailed of any other I have ever read.  I am 70 years old, and I have been riding literally for 57 years.  I got my first bike at 13, and have never stopped riding since that day.  I have ridden/raced flat track, motocross, desert, sport bikes, road race etc. and I am still in good health and continue riding aggressively.  I currently own 4 motorcycles, one for each category, and it is a continual challenge finding and maintaining the proper set-up of suspension damping, ride height, tire pressure etc, and all of the parameters are continuously changing with seasons, tire wear, suspension hours between rebuild etc.  Also all of my bikes are heavily modified with engine performance increase, and chassis weight reduction.  I generally replace all the body work with carbon fiber items, replace all fasteners with Titanium, use light weight forged wheels, light weight brake rotors,  etc etc etc.  I generally spend more money on aftermarket parts than the original cost of the bike brand new.  Typically my bikes end up with a 10-20% increase in power and 10-20% lighter weight.   I weigh 215 pounds without gear so I always use heaver springs, and also re-valve forks and shocks.  These performance gains totally affect the suspension and tire requirements, and the bike is completely different than a stock version, so manufacture's suggested settings are no longer valid.  I am on my own.  I have studied all of the above for years and generally get good results, but there is never a time where I can set it and forget it.  Normally when I go riding I take along a digital thermometer and a digital tire pressure gauge that reads in increments of 0.1 psi. I am continually checking tire temps and tire pressures and making adjustments.  I carry the necessary tools for damping adjustments, and I also use a hydraulic, or X-Trig shock preload adjustment that allows me to easily change rear ride  height.  It is rare that I do not have to make some adjustments during a given long ride.  I use rear ride height to effect steering, and tire pressure and damping to effect traction.  I would be lost if I didn't have a good background of knowledge in order to know what to change in order to improve an undesirable handling condition.  I have a copy of Race Tech's Suspension Bible by Paul Thede and Lee Parks which is loaded with excellent info, and I have read it cover to cover several times, but frankly, it is sometimes too detailed, and I get bogged down.  Your article boils it down into easy-to-understand terms and I totally agree with everything you have said.  Bravo!  I have saved this website and will recommend it to others.\r\nBest regards,\r\nDaniel Erickson"
