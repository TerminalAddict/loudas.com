message: "Good read, nice spot. Been there twice but never stayed. You wouldn't want to get caught out across the river with a flash flood (which was my concern having spent much time in the army training land). \r\n\r\nMaybe you could start a YouTube channel showing your adventures. People are making a living of that stuff. Check out the 'Epic family road trip', first seen them in New Zealand but they are from Canada. Anyway keep up with your own adventures and posting on the gwm (not much out there and people are searching) you might get a good following."
