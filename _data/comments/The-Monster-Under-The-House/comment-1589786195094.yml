  One of the most disturbing and sad things to read is someone who airs their
  personal  laundry on social media. Especially when  they blame someone else
  for a relationship ending.. without the other person getting the opportunity
  to share their side of the story. The bigger person stands tall and keeps that
  stuff to themselves. I dont personally know you but it shows how insecure you
  are to have to mention Helen's name and accuse her of some pretty major
  things. Being a survivor myself of domestic violence.... It sounds like you
  are the narcissist. Have some respect not only for Helen but for yourself. 
  How sad.....
