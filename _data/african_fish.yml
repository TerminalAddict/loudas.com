- name: "Livingstoni"
  scientific_name: "Nimbochromis livingstonii"
  image: livingstoni.jpg
  habitat: "Endemic to Lake Malawi. It is found in relatively shallow water around the shoreline, though it can also be seen in deeper (it has been recorded at depths of over 100m) water. These areas usually have soft substrates of mud or sand and are often thickly vegetated with beds of Vallisneria."

- name: "Kennyi cichlid"
  scientific_name: "Maylandia lombardoi / Pseudotropheus lombardoi"
  image: kennyi.jpg
  habitat: "Endemic to Lake Malawi. It has a limited natural range, being confined to the Mbenji Islands and Nkhomo Reef, but has also successfully been introduced around Namalenje Island. It inhabits the intermediate zone, where the rocky shoreline gives way to sandy substrates. These areas are characterised by large amounts of sediment."

- name: "Peacock cichlid"
  scientific_name: "Aulonocara sp."
  image: peacock_cichlid.jpg
  habitat: "Inhabits the so-called intermediate zones of the lake, where rocky shores give way to sandy bottoms with scattered rocks. It displays a preference for natural caves, and several males may possess territories in larger examples, with dominant individuals tending to be located higher up and have darker colour patterning."

- name: "OB Peacock cichlid"
  scientific_name: "Aulonocara sp. OB"
  image: ob_peacock_cichlid.jpg
  habitat: "OB Peacocks are a man made cross bred species, not a naturally occurring fish at all. The name OB is used to describe the varying black blotches that occur in many cichlid species. The originally discovered OB's were 'orange blotched', orange as you would expect, but the name has stuck and is used to describe all blotched fish, including those that are more pink/white, than orange. You will see quite a variety of colours on these fish, including varying degrees of blues, reds and yellows, as well as the pinkish/white background, and the dark blotches."
