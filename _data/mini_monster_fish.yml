  habitat: "Flowerhorn breeding dates from 1993. Taiwanese and Malaysians admired fish with protruding heads, known as 'kaloi' or 'warships', found in the western part of the nation. The slightly protruding forehead and long tail of these fish were prized in Taiwanese society as bringing luck in geomancy. By 1994, red devil cichlids (typically Amphilophus labiatus) and trimac cichlids (Amphilophus trimaculatus) had been imported from Central America to Malaysia and the hybrid blood parrot cichlid had been imported from Taiwan to Malaysia and bred these fish together, marking the birth of the flowerhorn. <p><!----></p><p>There is a great care guide a <a href='https://www.tankarium.com/flowerhorn/' title='Flowerhorn Care Guide - Diet, Tank Mates And Other Tips' target='_blank'>TANKARIUM.com</a></p>"
