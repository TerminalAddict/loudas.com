So all started Matt giving us a fishtank [Aquariums are the best]({% post_url 2018-02-18-aquariums-are-the-best %}).

Come January and I starting to trust the tank stand less and less.  
It is made from MDF, and has got wet in its' life, so is getting a bit dodgy.

Many years ago Simon Macaskill made a tank stand for a 1000 litre tank that I ended up owning.  
It was welded angle iron, and super strong!  
So a few emails later to Simon, and I start building a new tank stand.

I planned to make a steel frame, and clad it with plywood, stain, and all would be well.

Well through some mis-thought contrustion, I end up with a steel frame that is too big for the current tank. Bummer.

So, I think to myself, I need a bigger tank.  
I thought this would be easy, but alas, no one makes aquariums anymore, so I start spamming everyone, and everywhere to find someone to make me a tank.  

Through the Waikato Aquarium Society I finally meet Luke Moynihan, based in Tauranga.

A few messages later, and I've paid a deposit on a new tank constructed to the exact dimensions I want.

The next day Matt tells me he's keen to get his tank back, which means I won't have a filter (I'd like to return his filter).

mmm, I think to myself, what about a sump?

So more messages to Luke, and I've got a sump design, and over flow design, and I've committed to a sump! (Actually I'm quite excited about having a sump again :) )
