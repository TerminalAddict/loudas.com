## About Paul
Here’s a wee bit about me.

Firstly about the name TerminalAddict. Many moons ago I was in a chat room (#musb on freednode) chatting with a bloke called DragonMage. DragonMage is a member of [Mandrivausers.org](http://mandrivausers.org){: target="_blank"}

Well I was helping some people with Mandrake (or some other distro, I can’t remember) and all my help was telling them to open a command line interface (CLI) which is also called a terminal, so soon enough DragonMage started saying I was addicted to the terminal.

The name developed from there, and I thought it was very appropriate for the following reasons
* I use a terminal for everything
* I am a smoker, which could be terminal, and I am addicted
* I ride motorcycles, which could be terminal, and I am addicted
* Many of my other hobbies / habits could be described the same way

So I stuck with the name, also it wasn’t being used anywhere, by anyone else, which is pretty amazing in this day and age.
