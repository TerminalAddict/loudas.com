Ok, so this year has seen some changes. Most notably the change of address as a result of leaving my wife last year. But some things, like the desire for a super chill living room, never changes.  

So yep, back in March 2018 I started down this whole vinyl / record player path. You can read about that first experience here: [The Willard super chill living room]({% post_url 2018-03-21-the-willard-super-chill-living-room %})

So, it hasn't really stopped, this idea of spinning vinyl. And so last weekend I find myself at a "retro" market.  
There is recycled clothing, almost entirely for girls, some trinket stalls selling old glass ash trays, and old tea sets, and even a furniture stall selling 70's dining tables, and hallway cabinets.  
And, of course, vinyl sellers and collectors.  

So I come home with a few new spins:

* Iron Maiden - Number of the beast
* Pink FLoyd - The wall
* Bon Jovi - Slippery when wet
* The Beatles - Sgt Peppers lonely hearts club band
* The Beatles - A hard day's night
* Black Sabbath - Paranoid

Anyway, I seem to have plenty of time on my hands to over think things, and to while away my hours, so why not think of a better way to produce sound from my vinyl collection?  
So, first things first: get myself a better turn table.  

Now this will cause all sorts of arguments with audiophiles.  
Which deck is better than which. Which deck can damage your vinyl. God, it's worse than Holden vs Ford, or Vi vs Emacs.  
**My decision** was based on, good reviews, good value for money (I mean, I'm not an audiophile), y'know, middle of the road - not too flash, not too budget.  
So I decided on the Audio Technica LP60X-BT.  

Well the first problem, the BT (bluetooth) doesn't connect with my amp, a Yamaha RX-V485. Well that sucks. So I dig out the RCA cable, to find out how it sounds.  


_**Wonderful**_ .... I mean JUST **WONDERFUL** ! ❤️  

Yep I got a video

**WONDERFUL** ! ❤️   

So, of course over the weekend, with the newly awakened love affair, I think - "Paul, what are you missing from life" so here's my list so far:  
* AC/DC - Highway to hell
* Guns'n'Roses - Appetite for destruction
* Metallica - ...and justice for all
* Nirvana - Nevermind
* Iron Maiden - Seventh son of a seventh son

I absolutely love these albums.  
But I bet before the day is out, I'll remember some more albums I _**absolutely love**_.  

So a quick click to TradeMe, and off to the Discount CDs store I trundle.
