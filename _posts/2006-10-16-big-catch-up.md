I've been completely slack keeping my blog even close to updated.
Lots of rides have happened since my last entry, the biggest, well at least the longest, was the “Coro loop” with Quasi, Titanium, Road Rash, and few others I never actually met.

I also took in a pub lunch at Okoriore the following sunday, which ended with me and Trace heading home in a tow truck, thanks to a nail in the back tyre.

The new Quasimoto red leather jacket is awesome. Massively warm, and fit almost perfectly (as seen in the feature photo)

Tyre were fitted on the week following the nail incident. I bought some Metzeler M3 sportec tyres, and had them fitted at 7100kms on the clock. It will be interesting to find out how long they last. They are however, a huge improvement over my previous Michellen Macadam’s.
