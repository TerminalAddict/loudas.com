I went for a monster ride today with about 60 other riders.

{% include thumbnail.html img="awakino.png" %}

Left Home about 8:30am. Headed south to Te kuiti, stopped for a smoke, and some gas, then headed west to Awakino.

The gorge through to Awakino was pretty interesting with ice/grit encountered a couple of times.

I was definitely the slowest rider in the group, but was completely tapped out on the Virago. It simply could not go any faster.

On the ride home I followed a Harley up to Te kuiti, which was good fun actually. He wasn’t in a hurry, and it was nice riding with someone, without feeling the pressure of keeping up.
Got behind a Yamaha FZ1 north of Te kuiti, but just couldn’t hold it on the hills, or the straights, so lost him very quickly, and spent the rest of my ride solo.

Arrived home at 4:30pm with sore legs, a sore ass, and so tired I can barely stay awake.

Great day, and I’m looking forward to doing it again  :)
