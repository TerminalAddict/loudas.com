Peter has bought a Suzuki vx800, and a ride was in order. So I headed to Te Awamutu to hook up with him, and head to the twisties.

Once again I found out just how fantastic to Hornet is. “Get off and start walking” speeds were reached more than once, and in the the tight windy stuff metal bits touched the tarmac for the first time.

His Brother in-law Malcolm has just bought an RF900 so I can see some *interesting* rides coming up in the future.

My 10,000 kms service is booked in for Thursday, I hope that doesn’t hurt the wallet too much, as I have just forked out for a flashy radar detector :)
