Well it's been a super quite month or two for owning a motorbike.


My life has become consumed by responsibility :()

  * Chairman of the board of trustees at Hamilton's Fraser High School
  * Post-graduate diploma in management studies
  * Working (at [NetValue](http://www.netvalue.net.nz "NetValue"){: target="_blank"} )

It is just a crazy time !!!

However, mostly as an act of diversion from my studies, I launched my own micro-blog site ( http://squeak.im ) cool name huh? :)
