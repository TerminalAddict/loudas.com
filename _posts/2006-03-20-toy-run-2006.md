Yesterday (Sunday) I went on one of the most amazing rides I have ever been on.
It wasnâ€™t because I rode especially well or anything, it was the sheer size of the group I rode with.

966 Motorcycles of all shapes and sizes turned to fund raise for Kids with cancer.

I meet with some folk from [http://www.kiwibiker.co.nz](http://www.kiwibiker.co.nz/){: target="_blank"} and joined in.

It was fantastic, and I can wait for my next group ride.

**WAY COOL !!!!!**
