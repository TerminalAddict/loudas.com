Well last weekend saw Tracey's first road ride. It was great fun being out with Trace, on her own bike, inspiring dreams of tours around the country :) from both of us.

She had a wee topple where the ground didn't quite meet her foot, but all is well, and if everything goes according to plan we will being doing rides over the summer.

Matt took the hornet out for a spin last weekend. He gets his full license next week (assuming he passes :) ) and is eager as to upgrade.

He had typical comments about the hornet .. lots of power, quiet light on the road etc etc. Nothing that surprised me.
