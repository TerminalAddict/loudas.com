I got the hard word from the wife this weekend to stay home, and stay off the bike :)

{% include thumbnail.html img="divi.png" %}

But I did fit in a quick ride over the divi to raglan on Saturday.

It was a good ride, following somebody on a TL1000 practicing a few moves I’ve picked up along the way.

The weather is looking good all week, so I reckon I’ll get a chance to do a few “after work” rides.

Today I head north through Gordonton, along lake road to Horotiu, and back home through Te Kowhai.
