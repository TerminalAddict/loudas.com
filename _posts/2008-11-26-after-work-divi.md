So a tyre is due .. things are getting a bit wobbly in the corners .. it could all be in my head, who knows, but I've decided on the Z6 rear tyre again, and it is booked in on Friday.

Today a quick blat of the divi was in order, mostly to see if I was feeling confident to join the twilight ride at Hamilton Honda. I don't think I am unfortunately, I think the back tyre is too shagged, and it is just not worth the risk.

Maybe in two weeks.

I guess I should talk to Boyds about why the hell this thing keeps jumping out of 5th gear :()
