Well a couple of weeks ago I finally got my full motorcycle license.
So this weekend was spent taking the kids for a ride.

{% include thumbnail.html img="full-license.png" %}

It is the first weekend, in what seems like ages, that it hasnâ€™t rained.
I took Ashleigh out for a tour around the Eastern, and southern parts of the Waikato, and Georgia I did short trip around west part of the basin.

Both made excellent pillions, but the bike struggles a little with the extra weight. but I have my eye on something else :)
