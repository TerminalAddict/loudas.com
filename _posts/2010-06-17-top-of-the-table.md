Well I ain't an expert .. but I seem to have adapted quite well to this game Team Fortress 2 :)

  
{% include thumbnail.html img="top-of-the-table.jpg" %}  
  
I've also (this month) purchased

  1. Battlefield: Bad Company 2
  2. Call of duty: Modern Warfare (cod4)
  3. Serious Sam: The Second Edition HD
  4. Lead and Gold - Gangs of the wild west

plus some single player games (Half Life 2 etc) the complete list [here](http://steamcommunity.com/id/TerminalAddict/games?tab=all){: target="_blank"}

All in all, too many late nights up playing games :)  .. It's all good; it balances against all that responsible research work I'm doing in my MBA :)
