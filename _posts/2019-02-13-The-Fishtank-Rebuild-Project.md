So it all started with Matt giving us a fishtank [Aquariums are the best]({% post_url 2018-02-18-aquariums-are-the-best %}).

Come January and I started to trust the tank stand less and less.  
It is made from MDF, and has got wet in its' life, so is getting a bit dodgy.

Many years ago Simon Macaskill made a tank stand for a 1000 litre tank that I ended up owning.  
It was welded angle iron, and super strong!  
So a few emails later to Simon, and I start building a new tank stand.

I planned to make a steel frame, and clad it with plywood, stain, and all would be well.

Well through some mis-thought in contruction, I end up with a steel frame that is too big for the current tank. Bummer.

So, I think to myself, I need a bigger tank.  
I thought this would be easy, but alas, no one makes aquariums anymore, so I start spamming everyone, and everywhere to find someone to make me a tank.  

Through the Waikato Aquarium Society I finally meet Luke Moynihan, based in Tauranga.

A few messages later, and I've paid a deposit on a new tank constructed to the exact dimensions I want.

The next day Matt tells me he's keen to get his tank back, which means I won't have a filter (I'd like to return his filter).

mmm, I think to myself, what about a sump?

So more messages to Luke, and I've got a sump design, and an over flow design, and I've committed to a sump! (Actually I'm quite excited about having a sump again :) )

after weeks of battling with plumbing, paint, stain, welding, sanding, etc etc I've finally finished and the new community tank is up and running.

## But wait .. there's more

So in the middle of researching tank filter designs, I came across so many examples of "predator" tanks. Basically a tank full of BIG fish.  
Man I'd love a predator tank!

So one night, I'm sitting with Helen discussing, and she says "Yeah that would be cool".

So a facebook post later, and I'm offered a six foot, fully setup tank!  
**amazing**

So, yeah, we're now a "two fishtank" family :)

The seller, Logan Mahon, who is a super keen aquarist, also had a couple of Severums, he offered them to me. He told me he tried breeding thewm with no luck.

They are a great addition to the tank, and both about 150mm at the moment.

## update

So now we are seriously a predator fish family.  
I've got myself the cutest looking baby Scleropages Jardinii, also called Jardini, Pearl Arowana, and  [Australian Arowana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleropages_jardinii){: target="_blank"}

It is **truely** a predator fish, warning this video has live food feeding, but is an example of what kind of monsters these fish turn into:

I'm super excited to grow this little baby :) Super excited !!

Anyway, here's a pic of the predator tank setup at the moment. Really looking forward to grwoing my Jardini and adding him.

And here's a pic of our living room now

no doubt I'll blog more about this :)
