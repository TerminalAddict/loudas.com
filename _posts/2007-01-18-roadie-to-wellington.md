So lying in bed on Wednesday January 3rd, 2007, Tracey asks me whether I had “achieved” enough this break.

My answer was “I would have liked to see more of the country”

With in an hour we had organised a baby-sitter for the kids, and were packing up ready for a North island tour.

The trip took us down to Taumaranui, through the “paraparas”, which is a twisty road road through to Wanganui, then down to Waikanae, and eventually to Wellington.

We sleep the night with my uncle in newtown, then left early on Thursday, North through hutt valley, over the Rimutakas (what a cool road that is, and I got my pegs down :) ), through the Wairarapa plans, and toward Napier.

From Napier to Taupo, then the final leg through the western access, past Mangakino, and finally home.

1257kms travelled, sore arses/knees/legs/wrists/you name it. But what a great trip.

Next we do we have decided to break the trip up in to smaller manageable legs :)
