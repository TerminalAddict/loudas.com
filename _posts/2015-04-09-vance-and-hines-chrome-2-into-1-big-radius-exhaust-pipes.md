So on Friday Helen and I stopped for coffee in Taupo (on our weekend adventure [see here](/bikes/2015/04/08/easter-2015-whangamomona-experience.html "Easter 2015 â€“ Whangamomona experience")). We parked in a line of bikes, one of which was a 2009 Harley Davidson FXDF Fatbob, and he had Vance and Hines 2-into-1 big radius exhaust pipes.

LOVELY !

Man they look sexy !

So yesterday I went and got me some, and today fitted them to the bike.

They are a bit noisier, much more shinier, and a heap more sexier !

Here's some pics
