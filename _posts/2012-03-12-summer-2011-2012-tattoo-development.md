They say tattoos are addictive, well if that's true I'm hooked.
  
I made the decision earlier in September 2011 I would "grow" my tattoo on my left arm.

It's now March 2012, and about another 25 hours of work has gone in to my arm .. erk :) I'm hooked.
  
I'll stop once my arm is finished though.
