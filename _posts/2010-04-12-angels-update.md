Well a few hundred kays or so later the Pirelli Angel ST Tyres are finally coming in to their own.

This weekend I did a short blat around Te Awamutu, Kihikihi, Arapuni, Okoroire, and then back home. The front tyre finally felt planted on the ground.

The down side is I broke my home made mount for my givi top box, so that is no longer attached, which means no radar detector .. grrr .. I must fix that!
