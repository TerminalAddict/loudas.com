On Easter weekend 2015 we (Paul and Helen) motorcycled to Wellington, mainly to visit Helen&#8217;s daughter Sarah, and sister (plus family including new born baby) Tracey.

We did manage to fit in one tourist adventure; we went to [Wet Workshop](http://wetaworkshop.com/visit-us/workshop-tours/tour/standard-tour){: target="_blank"}, where we took a tour (no photography allowed sorry).
  
Then on Sunday we headed to [Whangamomona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whangamomona){: target="_blank"} via Stratford, where we met with Warren and Robyn, and Richard on their bikes stayed the night at the [AWESOME hotel](http://www.whangamomonahotel.co.nz/){: target="_blank}, then rode back to Hamilton together.

The other interesting thing is I bought an action camera this week. I've been thinking about a gopro for a while, but at $540 + accessories and attachments, it is just too much!

So on to trademe I went to see if I could find a secondhand one. Instead I found a new [SJCAM SJ4000](http://www.sjcam.com/home/27-sjcam-sj4000-wifi-1080p-full-hd-action-camera-sport-dvr.html){: target="_blank}. I did a bunch of research, and watched a heap of comparison videos on youtube etc before deciding that at $180 this is the camera I should buy!

The result is great !!

I spent some time with Adobe Premiere Pro as well piecing together a small 5 second intro that I can use with my biking videos.

## Whatcha think ?

So of course I had play around with different places to mount the camera on the bike. I totally got in touch with my inner movie director :)

So here is the result, a 10 minute long video of our Easter weekend motorcycling adventure.

Enjoy !!!
