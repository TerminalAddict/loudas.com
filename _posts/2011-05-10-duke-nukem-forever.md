### Pre-Purchase Duke Nukem Forever

It seems like this game has been a million years in the making, but finally after a million years the pre-release goes live today !!!!


> _The King is Back!_
> 
> Cocked, loaded and ready for action, Duke delivers epic ass-kicking, massive weapons, giant explosions and pure unadulterated fun!
> 
> Put on your shades and step into the boots of Duke Nukem. The alien hordes are invading and only Duke can save the world. Pig cops, alien shrink rays and enormous alien bosses canâ€™t stop this epic hero from accomplishing his goal: to save the world, save the babes and to be a bad-ass while doing it.
> 
> The King arrives with an arsenal of over-the-top weapons, non-stop action, and unprecedented levels of interactivity. With hours and hours of action, and a range of bodacious multiplayer modes, rest assured knowing the fun goes on and on.
