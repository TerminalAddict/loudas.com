Well Team Fortress 2 seems to have taken pride of place in the gaming time for me. It really is huge fun.

Me wearing: Hound Dog, Ear buds, Killing Gloves of Boxing (KGBs)


after countless hours of collecting items (a lot I want to keep) so that I can craft stuff, I finally did my first hat craft today.

It cost me 4 refined metal, and 1 heavy class token.

The result: A Hound Dog

Screenshot provided :) (I couldn't resist)

I've now got:

  * Professional's Panama (sniper)
  * Tippler's Tricorne (demoman)
  * Parasite Hat (thanks valve for the free game)
  * Ghastly Gibus (just like everybody else)
  * Hound Dog (Heavy)

The Hound dog is my first "crafted" hat, all other have been "found".

I'd really like a hat for my Pyro and my Soldier!!!
