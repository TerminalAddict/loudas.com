So after a few trips away, and not being able to lock things in the back, and having committed to a [light bar]({% post_url 2021-05-06-GWM-Cannon-LED-Lightbar-install %}) on my roof racks (which means I can't carry my snow board ðŸ˜’), I finally caved to installing a hard lid.  
I mean, I always wanted one, I just didn't want to pay [Ute Master](https://utemaster.co.nz){: target="_blank"} prices.  
So, I designed and built my own hard lid.  

## I dub thee 'Truck Norris' 
Yep, that's right! I named my GWM Cannon truck! ðŸ¤£  
<strong>Truck Norris</strong>

And that's all I have to say about that ðŸ˜‚  

## The Hard Lid Design 
Like many projects, this started with a pencil, then some [Adobe&copy; Illustrator&copy;](https://www.adobe.com/nz/products/illustrator.html){: Target="_blank" %}, then some backwards and forwards with a friends who knows more than me.  
This time that friend was Bipin.  

Bipin is a welder/fabricator guy at [Ullrich Aluminium](https://www.ullrich-aluminium.co.nz){: target="_blank" %}  

So, we start with a basic design:

And some shopping (Thanks [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com){: target="_blank" })  
{% include thumbnail.html img="central locking unit.jpg" %}  

And .. my new favourite shop !!!  
[Co-Mac](https://www.comac.co.nz){: target="_blank" %}  
This store is amazing ! They have everything you could possibly imaging for fabrication.  
In my case, recessed tie downs, slam door latches, pop-up handles, gas struts .. etc etc etc.

Then Bipin and I start work!

### The Wiring
So, the wiring was a lot easier than I initially thought.  
Thanks to [Savage Tech Australia](https://savagetech.com.au){: target="_blank" %}, who also sells a central locking unit, I knew what wires I had to tap into. Reg/Green, and Green.  
> Note: Use the <strong>thin</strong> Red/Green wire, not the thick Red/Green wire !

If you check my [light bar]({% post_url 2021-05-06-GWM-Cannon-LED-Lightbar-install %}) post, I used the same rubber gromet to get the power from the central locking in to the left rear door.  

And here is the central locking unit installed:

## Conclusion
And, here is the finished prodict:
