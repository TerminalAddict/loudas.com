So today with Warren's direction :) I removed the front forks, getting ready to send them off to [HenryDorsetCase](http://www.kiwibiker.co.nz/forums/member.php?u=2126 "HenryDorsetCase"){: target="_blank"}

HenryDorsetCase made me an [offer](http://www.kiwibiker.co.nz/forums/showthread.php?t=89785){: target="_blank"} 3 days ago; I send him my standard OEM forks, and $1000, and he sends me his [racetech](http://www.racetech.com/ "RaceTech"){: target="_blank"} forks, and a [46DR Ohlins](http://www.mrpmotorsports.com/review/product/list/id/7068/){: target="_blank"} shock.

Sweet deal ! Considering just days earlier I had been emailing [Robert Taylor](http://crownkiwi.co.nz/ "Crown Kiwi"){: target="_blank"}, and [Shaun Harris](http://www.kiwibiker.co.nz/forums/member.php?u=4323){: target="_blank"} getting prices

Anyway, I thought it would be a very nerdy thing indeed to document my process.

Here are some photos:
