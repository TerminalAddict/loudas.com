So, 2020 (a lot of thanks to Covid-19 or Corona virus) has been mental **still** it doesn't seem to be ending 😭 !  
So today I thought I'd write about some things.

<!--more-->

## Covid-19 Update
So, we're now at level 2, meaning shopping can still be tricky; we have a tracker app so the gubbermint knows where we are at all times, and yeah ... whatever 😲  
But, we're allow on the boat!  

For a while we couldn't do that, so there was a lot of beer drinking 🤣  
Thanks [Good George](https://www.goodgeorge.co.nz/){: target="_blank"}🥂

err .. I might've put on some weight 😲  

## Employment update
Well, things came to an end at the ISP I was working for.  
And as such, right now (September 09) I'm not working full time.  

One of the biggest annoyances was the job came with a 4x4, which was great for Snowboarding!  

Alas I had to return the car. So, I thought to myself: "Myself, you need your own 4x4".  

So sitting in a boat with Matt one day, he says "I'm friends with Aaron Keppler, he's part of [Keppler motors](https://keppler.co.nz/){: target="_blank"}".  
mean!!

So Keppler offer me an amazing deal; trade my 4x2 Greatwall ute for a 4x4 Greatwall SUV.  

So the Ute went to a new home, and I came home with a Greatwall x200, the same year as my ute! and the same Kms as my ute!  
{% include thumbnail.html img="greatwall-x200.jpg" %}   

Of course the sound system sucked in the x200 .. so a trip to [Mad Soundz](http://madsoundz.nz/){: target="_blank"} fixed that.

## The dating update
Well, I was seeing someone whom I met through Bumble (the dating app).  
It was nice but didn't last. It seemed to me she didn't cope very well when I lost my job. Or at least her unhappiness coincided with me losing my job.  
Ah well ... I think she had a good time for a while, and so did I.  
We even made it to the snow (my only trip to the snow so far this season!) 🌨️ 🏔️ ⛄ ❄️ 🏂 ⛷️  
{% include thumbnail.html img="me_snow_2020.jpg" %}  

I've since started seeing someone else  😮   
It's going really nice .. time will tell.

## Friends and hobbies
Well .. I had the meanest catch up with Susan Karl one night !  
Sheesh Susan, we go back a long way  😮   
{% include thumbnail.html img="susank_and_me.jpg" %}   

And, since I'm feeling a bit chucky 🤣 😝 I figured it was time to get off my arse!  
So Teresa Norgren and I have been walking. Most days, and every weekend for the last month or so I think.  

Firstly, up Mount Maunganui.  
{% include thumbnail.html img="top_of_the_mount.jpg" %}  

Then up the Hakarimatas (the Huks).  
{% include thumbnail.html img="me_teresa_huks.jpg" %}   
OMG! 😮🤣😝  

Then up Pirongia.  
{% include thumbnail.html img="me_teresa_pirongia.jpg" %}  

Plenty of fishing.  
{% include thumbnail.html img="2020-kahawai.jpg" %}  

and of course .....  
Lots of coffee drunk in the mild Winter weather though !  
{% include thumbnail.html img="me_at_the_mount.jpg" %}  

Teresa and I took Lexi up Pukemokemoke last weekend.  
Lexi cried 😆 🐶 🐾🐾   

Oh, and the motorbike is registered, and I've been out on my first ride this season ... lovely 💖 🥰 💕 

## What's next ?

I've not visited the snow since the beginning of the season, not sure whether I'll get to the snow again this year 🤷‍♂️ .
🌨️ 🏔️ ⛄ ❄️  🏂 ⛷️

I really need to visit the snow again!  

And I reckon a week at the beach is due this summer!
