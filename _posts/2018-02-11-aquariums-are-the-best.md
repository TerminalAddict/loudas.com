So I've had fish tanks for most of my life, except for the last 4 years. A week or so ago a nagging thought entered my head, "I need an aquarium".

I'd been looking around, and while fishing for a weekend started talking to Matt about it.

You can have my 3 foot tank, says Matt.

The tank had been stored for a while so needed a little love.

New top, which I fashioned from a piece of perspex from the hardware store. Some paint on the stand. Some re-wiring of the hood light.

So here I am. Day one, waiting for a few weeks for the tank to cycle.

I've got Co2 diffusing into the inlet, and spent days researching the best substrate for plant growth. I've introduced two Rainbows to start the Ammonia->Nitrite->Nitrate cycle.
