So the last big trip was a wee 780kms loop with Tracey on the back.

A quick blat to Otorohonga, quickly turned into a loop around Mount Taranaki, and then inland through “The forgotten World Highway”.  
Its a fantastic, technical, and challenging ride for anyone.  
It was a nice warm distance heading in to the Grand challenge in 3 weeks (October 13 and 14).  
The grand challenge will be an arduous journey, being 1000 miles in 24 hours or less.  

I have mixed feeling about the grand challenge. Both excitement, and a little fear :)
