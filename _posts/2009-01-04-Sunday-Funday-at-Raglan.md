Well today was "day with the family" day - fortunately for me this included riding and fishing :) yeehaa

{% include thumbnail.html img="007-copy-4.jpg" %}

The riding was ok, Tracey has been nursing a sore neck for a few weeks so she wasn't keen on any lengthy ride, so a quick flick over the divi was in order.

On the way back I remember some old timer saying to me "You don't really know a road until you can ride it with no brakes" So the challenge was on :) no brakes it was - just using the engine braking to set corner entry speed .. t'was good fun.

Once home the kids wanted to chase a fish, and fancied Raglan as a good place to go, so back over the divi in the car with fishing rods aboard .. sweet day in the sun all in all
