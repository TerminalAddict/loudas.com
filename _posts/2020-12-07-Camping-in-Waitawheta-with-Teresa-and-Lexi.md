We are headed to Waitawheta Valey, specifically [Dickey's Flat](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/bay-of-plenty/places/kaimai-mamaku-conservation-park/things-to-do/dickey-flat-campsite/){: target="_blank"}

Soon after, both Teresa and I have itchy feet; we need to walk!  
So we head north towards Karangahake gorge. Great news! Lexi is allowed in the bush here (on a lead).

We are headed toward the [Windows Walk](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/bay-of-plenty/places/kaimai-mamaku-conservation-park/things-to-do/tracks/karangahake-windows-walk/){: target="_blank"} where gold mines used to exist, and a series of tunnels were built for miners to get into the valley.  
We are taking the [Crown track](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/bay-of-plenty/places/kaimai-mamaku-conservation-park/things-to-do/tracks/crown-track-to-dickeys-flat/){: target="_blank"}  
It's about 3kms to the mine tunnels, then a 3km loop trough the tunnels, then 3kms back.

Lexi encounters her first swing bridge üòÇ and she was a bit scared üí©

We explore a few tunnels while we headed up the valley, which was super cool.

Eventually getting back to camp 3 ish hours later; Lexi dragging her feet !  

We set up for the night.  
Cook a meal.  
In bed, tucked up in our sleeping bags before dark.  
And no, Lexi did not sleep in the tent, and she wasn't happy about it !

Up the next morning, and we headed to the mount for a swim before heading home.  
Check out the amazing pics I go of a Pohutukawa across the road from the Mount place.
