This month certainly has been a month of adventure. I've met someone who lives 77 kms away in Paeroa; Lara. As a result much of my spare time has been spent in Paeroa, or with Lara in Hamilton.

I still managed an over night walk in to Waitawheta, a Cycle ride on the Hauraki Rail Trail, and a night out to a German beer fest .. great month so far.
