Man I'm terrible at blogging :) Anyway, this month I finally (after months of planning, and preparing) completed Waikaremoana.

{% include thumbnail.html img="IMG_4976.jpg" %}  

It's 46kms, can be done in three days, I took four days; my last day was 1 hour long then a 5 hour drive back to Hamilton.

Great fun!
  
This week (tomorrow) I'm headed to Tongariro
  
Hope the weather holds out.
