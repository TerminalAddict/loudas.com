Went out for a while yesterday, for an hour or so.

Confidence is getting much better, but she really needs low speed work before she can even think of going near a town. mmm .. must think about how to achieve that, maybe back to the carpark for a while?

Good fun tho :) .. I had Death Magnetic playing in the helmet while I was riding :) good fun!
