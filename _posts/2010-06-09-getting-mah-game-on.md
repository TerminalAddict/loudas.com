well after resisting for many years (3 infact) I have finally bitten the bullet and bought Team Fortress 2

The Orange box from steam was a sweet buy, coupled with Left 4 Dead 2, and I have an awesome gaming experience right now.

I also splashed out for a Logitech g15, which I haven't got just yet .. hopefully as sweet as I expect it to be.

check me out on steam :)
