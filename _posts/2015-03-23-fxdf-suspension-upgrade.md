So this Friday I trucked down to Kiwi SuspensionÂ Solutions.

They had an ex-demo set of Ohlins HD022's .. how could I resist. At nearly half price, reconditioned like new, and perfect for the Fatbob, why not I said to myself.

So on went the shocks, of course while I was there Robert Taylor kindly suggested I do my forks as well :)

This weekend however, was consumed by building a home for the fatty, so I spent nearly all weekend constructing a shed to garage the beast !

Here's some pics:
