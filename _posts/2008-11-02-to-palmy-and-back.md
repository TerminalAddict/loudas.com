So after complaining that I have ridden properly for months, I thought a trip down to fielding / palmerston north was in order.

{% include thumbnail.html img="005-copy-3.jpg" %}

5:33pm I'm out of the office and on the bike ready to go.

The pace from Hamilton to Te Kuiti was quite sedate, as I had been telling myslef this was going to be a nice gentle cruise, all about enjoying the scenery etc etc etc - of course once I was on the road, and in particular that road from Otorohonga to Taumaranui, I couldn't resist, and of course the pace got up.

First stop Taumaranui:

186 kms, 12.7 litres, average speed 107

Stop for a quick smoke, and send some text messages to people updating my progress, and I'm off again.

South down through national park, and east through Ohakune.

Second stop Waiouru to get some warmer clothes on as it is now it completely dark.

52 minutes from Taumaranui to Waiouru, 105kms .. average speed 121

Off I go down SH1. I forgot to take note of time, or speed etc, but next stop was Taihape for 10 litres of gas, after travelling 86kms (thank goodnes I did, evey other gas station was closed after this one)

Arrive in fielding for a welcome cold beer .. or 3

On Saturday I had plans to head back to Hamilton, but to be honest I was quite hung over, and the weather was shit as - so I mooched about at Matt and Lauren's house until I had a chance to catch a wee nana nap.

Awoken by my lovely wife checking up on me, and it was decided I should stay another night, shake the hang over, and pray for better weather :)

Saturday night Lauren and I headed to otaki to meet a few of the locals at a BBQ hosted by bren, twas interesting, and caught up with some people I haven't seen in quite a quile (Chanceyy, skunk, Mrs Skunk) twas good to see them

Sunday the sun is shining, my head is not throbbing .. all is good in the world.

Matt rugs up, and escorts me through vinegar hill, and on to Taihape.

He's fast by the way - grrr - heaps fast

Stop at Taihape for fag, and something to drink, and a quick read of the map to figure where Matt could go exploring.

He heads south, I head north.

The weather is so great I decide to head straight up SH1 through the desert road for some snaps of the bike, and the snow, and the desert

Next stop Taupo. The reserve light has been nagging me for a while, 226kms at Taupo, and 15.5 litres of fuel, not bad I reckon, I had another 2 litres to get through :)

Now I am on familiar roads, heading past kinloch towards Mangakino, and through to Kihikihi.

The pace here just go diabolical .. but fun all the same

Old favourite roads all the way home, in a time of 4 hours 24 minutes, door to door, including stops (at Taihape with Matt, Taupo for gas, and bryces cafe in the middle of nowhere for a fag)

All in all a weekend well spent.

Paul.
