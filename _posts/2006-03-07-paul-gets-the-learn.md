Started work this morning, and like many mornings I was busy and stumbled across this [thread](http://www.kiwibiker.co.nz/forums/showthread.php?t=18434){: target="_blank"}

The reply posted by vifferman ([here](http://www.kiwibiker.co.nz/forums/showpost.php?p=373968&postcount=3){: target="_blank"}) reminded me of something I have been meaning to post.

2 weeks ago I bought a new virago, and on sunday I took it out (between storms) for about 3 hours.

Wandered around north waikato for about an hour, then headed over the divi to raglan.

The road to raglan has *some* twisties, but is mostly a 100+ drive, however, being a learner the order of the day was 95 kph ride.

On one corner, right hand bend, probably marked as 85 kms (I didn't notice) I felt the bike running REAL wide.
Classic noob I look at where I was going to crash, and went for the brake.

In a split second (before I reached the brakes) I was reminded of something:

[this post:](http://www.kiwibiker.co.nz/forums/showpost.php?p=365571&postcount=21){: target="_blank"}

I re-adjusted my vision pointed my chin at the exit to the corner, and magically I was riding round it.

DUDE !!!!! this rocks - few seconds to let the heart settle down back to normal pace, then think to myself .. fucking crashe !!! you rock (and everybody else who mentors us wee folk)

So this is a big **FUCK YEAH**
