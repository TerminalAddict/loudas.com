So, as "man crushes" go, I guess Dave Moss is fairly high up on my list of motorbike gurus.

He is largely recognised as a world leader in suspension tuning for motorcycles, and as luck would have it, in my town this weekend.

A bunch of road safety organisations were running a show thing called "Shiny Side Up", and Dave Moss was the star attraction.

I wasn't expecting to get any tent time, and was fully planning on sitting in the tent and listening for the day.

Turns out he had spare time. wicked !!

So I spent all Saturday listening, asking questions, and fiddling with the suspension on my SV. What a lucky score!

Dave is a super cool guy to talk to, and really keen on talking with people about bikes, and sharing his knowledge.

Thanks Dave! A very memorable weekend.
