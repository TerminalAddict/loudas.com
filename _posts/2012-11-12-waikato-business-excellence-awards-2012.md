Of course that's not all that has gone on the last few months. What a life packed full of fun and adventure we've had ! The Pirongia craft day, a visit to Auckland to see Lyndsay and her new man, so many dinners and lunches in amazing places, with amazing food. Just an amazing time.

And Dancing ! so much dancing !

I never thought I would enjoy dancing as much as I do, who'da thunk?

There's been dance parties, lessons, workshops, fantastic ! all done with Will and Tina at Addiction Dance. Getting photos of me dancing seems to have eluded me though :) must work on that!
