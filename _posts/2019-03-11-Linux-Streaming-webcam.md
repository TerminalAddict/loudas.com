So as I mentioned in [The Fishtank Rebuild Project]({% post_url 2019-02-13-The-Fishtank-Rebuild-Project %}), I bought a big tank!
I've got plans to stock this with, probably, very expensive fish, that are quite rare.

So being a nerd, and having a spare Logitech webcam sitting around, I built a wee webcam streaming service, so I can spy on my big fish tank.

I reckon it looks pretty cool.

If you're interested in how I did this, you can checkout the geeky stuff on:

Here is the camera in action:

Since upgrading to Debian Buster my motion software has broken.  
The stream _was_ located here:  
[Fish Cam]({{ site.url}}/assets/php/webcam1.php){: target="_blank"}
