So Labour weekend (October) also brings with it the end of the snow season in NZ, _sad face_. But, _happy face_, lots of sunshine!
I've had such an awesome Winter this year; learning to snowboard, and then snowboarding almost every weekend!
**Amazing**

I've taken countless photos. The views from up the top of Mt Ruapehu are just awe inspiring for a first timer.
Look at this:

Plus I've got to buy some cool gear :) I **love** toys :P
* Snowboard (Burton Process Flying V)
* Bindings (Burton Cartel EST)
* Pants (RPM-MFG)
* Jacket (RPM-MFG and GSOU Snow)
* Mitts (Level one GTX Halfpipe)
* Goggles (Oakleys, but I'm replacing them with SunGod Revolts)
    * I love SunGod's by the way [see here](/assets/manual_uploads/DearSunGod.pdf){: target="_blank"}

anyways .. lists are boring .. here's another view:
