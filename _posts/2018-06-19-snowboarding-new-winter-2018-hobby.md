So Winter 2018 is here, and with it, an invitation to go to France for Christmas !

A White Christmas! and some time in the snow. Of course I don't know how to ski or snowboard. Helen has been skiing before, but me, nothing.

So we better learn this snowboarding bizzo before we go on holiday. So this weekend we went for our first day snowboard lesson at Whakapapa.

There was lots of falling over, lots of laughs, and HEAPS of fun!
  
We had 4 hours of lesson where we learnt:

  * Toe Sliding
  * Heel Sliding
  * Skating and one foot riding
  * Getting on and off a magic carpet (in preparation for the chair lift)
  * And started with our turns

The photo makes me look really grumpy, but I wasn't! I think I was just mentally tired by learning a new thing :)

We're going back next weekend for a 3 day weekend.

Wish us luck!
