I’ve been riding all week, every day, and enjoying my bike thoroughly :)
This morning however was a chilly experience, and evident that the season for long day rides is drawing to a close, oh well.

Next week I’m off on holiday for a month, so I expect when I return the nights will be long.

I did however, go for a blat tonight to Te Awamutu and back. Down the back road past Pirongia and back up the main road through Rukuhia.

It was great fun, and I didn’t slow for the darkness :) in fact I think darkness makes you trust the traction of the rubber a little more.

Still .. I’m pining for that Triumph speedmaster or Bonneville America. I can see me riding it already :)
