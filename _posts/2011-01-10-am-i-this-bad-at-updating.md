Apparently yes :)

This month I registered [fps.net.nz](http://www.fps.net.nz){: target="_blank"} and started a steam group [FPSNZ](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/fpsnz){: target="_blank"}

I'm hoping to get some people together from NZ that are interesting in First Person Shooters.

I also bought Call of Duty Black Ops, and Battlefield 2 complete collection (coz it was on sale). The Steam Christmas sales were awesome, but I didn't spend that much as I bought so much last year, and nothing much new has come out. I'm keen for battlefield 3 if it ever comes out, but my most looked forward to game has to be Portal 2, that will be awesome I bet !!
